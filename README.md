# templateGL {#mainpage}
A template for c++ projects using OpenGL. This is a basic OpenGL
application with some useful custom tools with the goal to make starting
a new OpenGL application easier by using this as a start point.

This code is based on the [tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-1-opening-a-window/)
from https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl.
